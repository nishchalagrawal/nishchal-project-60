            <h1>Hi!</h1>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <p>Football is my favourite hobby. It’s a team
                sport, in which you can score only by placing
                the ball inside the goal of the opposite team.
                Teams content 11 players – field players and a
                goalkeeper. The goalkeeper’s role is to protect
                the goal. He’s the only person that can touch
                the ball with his hands, but only in his penalty
                area. There are also 3 men which are not
                playing, these are the refferees.
                • Personally I play football for both training and
                fun. Many contacts with the ball improve the
                technique, and moving on the pitch builds the
                condition. Additionaly scoring a goal or
                blocking a dangerous shot is a really nice
                feeling, what makes football a good game for
                minimizing the stress. It’s good to have an onfield idol, that you can watch to improve your
                skills. My idol is Kaka’, because I love the way
                he dribbles and passes.
                • While playing, you must remember that
                football is a team game. Individual actions
                may be satisfying, but there’s more pleasure i was 13 year old.</p>
